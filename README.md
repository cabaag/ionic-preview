in an atom pane.

# Getting start

In your terminal:
'''
apm install ionic-preview
ionic serve -b
'''

Then hit `Cmd + Shift + P` in atom and use the command `Ionic: Preview`

(note: if you don't see `Ionic: Preview` in the list you may need to restart atom)

This will open a new pane with your app displayed in it.
